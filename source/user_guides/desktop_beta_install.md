Due to the app being still in Beta, some manual steps are required to install or upgrade the App.

## MacOS

* Open the Finder and in its menu click `Go`.
* Select `Go To Folder...` and enter `~/Library/Application Support/Status`.
* Backup this folder somewhere else if you need it.
* Remove the folder and copy `Status.app` from the opened `Status.dmg` to the Applications folder.

## Linux

* Backup the `~/.config/Status` directory if you need it.
* Delete the `~/.config/Status` directory.

## Windows

* Press the Start button, select `Run` (or Windows Key + R) and type: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Status`.
* Backup this folder somewhere else if you need it.
* After backup, remove the folder and move the unzipped Status folder to your preferred location.
